Today I went to Insight and I feel that I am closer to understanding the volume of a high dimensional cube problem. I still have a lot of issues managing my time. There are so many things that I want to do and there just isn't any time to do them all. I really must prioritize. Today I had a talk with Asya about starting a company with her doing Social Media Climbing. I told her that I want 50% and for us to be equal partners. She first argued about the number, but my point is rather simple: we're in this to win it and we need to be partners. Money is not an issue. I hope to god that I get hired with a decent salary so I can continue to improve my skills and make money while I'm at it. In such a circumstance, I'll be able to fund the company with my sister. I'm not sure exactly what kind of corporate structure we will have, and I probably need to consult some people about that. I want us to make a prove of concept, have some kind of baseline project where we will prove that what we're doing can work. I think a $2000 budget is reasonable for this purpose. If it works out then we'll have a blueprint on how to proceed. As for everything else, lets wait and see. Keep working and making things happen, don't get depressed. Read end of stress! I know that today was a bit shitty since you came so late, but tomorrow is another day, make it count!
