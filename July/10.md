I'm continuing my progress with lifebloom and it is not easy. My journey to read elements of statistical learning is hitting a bit of a roadblock. I'm trying to fill a few gaps of understanding that I have. And on this knowledge gap trip, I went all the way back to calculus and the chain rule. I feel that I am close to getting what I need, but I'm not quite there yet.

I argued with an extremely rude person online today, but I don't care that much. I dealt with shitty people all my life, so whats one more piece of garbage. I'm actually really tired now, so I don't think I'll write any mroe but I need to find a way to make these entries a bit more thoughtful.
